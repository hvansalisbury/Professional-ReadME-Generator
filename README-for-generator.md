## Description

This is a command line tool that will prompt the user to respond to questions and generate a README.md file based on the responses. This will create the markdown file with the proper format and syntax. This README was created using this tool.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation

The user must have Node.js installed as well as npm inquirer.js. Then the user must save index.js as well as generateMarkdown.js saved in their correct folders.

## Usage

Open the command line to the folder index.js is stored. Then type node index.js in the command line. You will then be prompted a series of questions. Answer each question. The responses will be used to populate the README.md file. Some fields are required and the README will not be generated if they left blank.

## License

This application is covered under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit) license.

## Contributing

At this time, I am not looking for any additional contributors for this project.

## Tests

To test the application, try answer all but one of the questions to see if the file is generated. A blank in any of the required fields will lead to no file created. Additionally, at least one of the email and github username fields are also required. A blank in either of these fields will lead to a no file created as well. If a unrequired field is left blank, that section will not be rendered and left out of the Table of Contents. Finally, choosing any of the options in the licsenses list will generate a badge as well as a link to the license on choosealicense.com. Try them all out to make sure they work. If none is selected, no license section will be generated.
